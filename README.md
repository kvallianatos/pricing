# pricing

Assumptions:
- Only one offer can be applied to each physical item
- Each item type only has one active offer at any given time
- There is no requirement to maintain the strict item scan order
- Currency is implied and not explicitly handled for simplicity
- Item identifiers are string names instead of internal UIDs for simplicity
